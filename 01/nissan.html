        <h2>Nissan and their sports cars</h2>
        <p>Nissan is one of the oldest Japanese car manufacturers. They have been producing cars since the 1930s. Nissan is known for their innovation and performance. They have produced many iconic cars over the years, such as the Z series and the Skyline. The Skyline is one of the most famous cars to come out of Japan. It has a long history of performance and racing heritage. The Skyline has been featured in many movies and video games, making it a true icon of Japanese car culture. <br> Nissan equally manufactured the Nissan Silvia, a cheaper alternative to the Skyline which is popular in drifting. The 1st generation fast back also known as the 180sx or 240sx in North America is my favorite.</p>
        <h4>The generations of The Silvia</h4>
